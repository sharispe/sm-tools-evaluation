Evaluation of tools for Semantic Measures
==============================================================

This project aims at comparing tools dedicated to semantic measures computation.
It has been initiated in order to evaluated the Semantic Measures Library (http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/), see the competing interest section for more information. 

The project contains the source code and details regarding the materials and methods used in the evaluations.
A detailed version of the results and discussions are provided at http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/index.php?q=performance

> Do not hesitate to help us improve the benchmark and to upgrade the tests with new tools or more recent versions of tools.

We propose:

1. Context specific evaluations. Numerous library and tools have been developed for domain-specific use cases (e.g. ontologies). 
Considering specific domain of use, we compare the tools in terms of performance and regarding other criteria such as dependencies, difficulty to use...

 * Molecular Biology and Biomedicine
   * Gene Ontology
   * Disease Ontology
 * WordNet

Competing interests
--------------------

This project has been initiated in order to evaluate the Semantic Measures Library SML.
As the developers of these tests are also developers of the SML we cannot ensure that this evaluation is free from bias.
Indeed we better know how to configure and use the SML than other tools. Do not hesitate to help us improve those tests.
